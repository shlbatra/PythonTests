- Write tests properly
- good test for updates and refactoring confidence
- everything still working after make changes to specific part of code/functionality
- Unit test assert methods link ->
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.debug
- Best Practices
    - Tests should be isolated -> not rely or affect other tests
    - test driven development -> write test before writing code (think what code do, write test for behaviour, fail test, write code to succeed that test)
    - pi test -> another version of testing instead of unittests
