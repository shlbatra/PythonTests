- Unit Test and Coverage
- Coverage - measure of how much of your code is tested (%)
- test fixture - env or context in which your code runs. ex fake dataset, mock or stop object that help you single out single piece of code, Ex. email enter -> go to database and send email -> mock email sending service (test without sending actual email) 
- unit tests more extensive than the app code
- python library for testing -> unittest, pytest
- pip install coverage ; coverage run <test file name>, get html report -> coverage html
- 1 -> Write code and then write unit tests
- 2 -> Test driven development, Write tests before implementation. As code, the test go from Fail to Pass. Define what expect of fn via test and just doing test passing for implementation.
- Coverage of 100% doesnt mean code is bug free
- Random data in unit test -> not good idea, unit test deterministic. Not use unit test as deployment stratergy -> some time code pass and some times fail -> no idea as using random data. 
- force to write code that is easy to test
- Strong Cohesion, Less Coupling, Single Responsibility -> Easy to test
